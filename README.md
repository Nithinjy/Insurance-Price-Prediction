# 🏥 Insurance Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project predicts **health insurance costs** based on user attributes such as age, gender, BMI, smoking habits, and region.  
It uses **Machine Learning (Linear Regression)** to analyze factors affecting insurance premiums.

2️⃣ Install Dependencies

Create a virtual environment (recommended) and install requirements:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Run Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook project.ipynb

📊 Dataset

The project uses the Insurance dataset with the following columns:

age: Age of the person

sex: Gender (male/female)

bmi: Body Mass Index

children: Number of children covered

smoker: Smoking status (yes/no)

region: Residential area (northeast, southeast, etc.)

charges: Medical insurance cost (target variable)

📈 Model Performance

Algorithm: Linear Regression

Accuracy: Achieved good prediction accuracy with R² score ≈ X.XX

Error Metrics: Evaluated using Mean Squared Error and RMSE
